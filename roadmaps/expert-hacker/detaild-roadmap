## CRITICAL MINDSET PRINCIPLES

1. **Embrace the Grind:** This is a 5,000-hour journey minimum
2. **Build, Don't Just Break:** Create tools to understand defense
3. **Document Everything:** Keep detailed notes of techniques
4. **Stay Curious:** The best hackers are endlessly curious
5. **Ethical Foundation:** Use skills responsibly and legally

This roadmap will take you from where you are now to being able to discover and exploit novel vulnerabilities. The key is consistent, daily practice and deep understanding rather than rushing through topics.
