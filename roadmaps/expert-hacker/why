This is an excellent and very important question. You've hit on the core difference between "script kiddie" / basic vulnerability knowledge and true advanced expertise. The feeling you're having is the catalyst that pushes people from being good to being great.

Let's break down exactly **why** you're struggling to find "real" resources and how to bridge that gap.

### The Core Misunderstanding: "Real Resources" vs. "The Method"

You're looking for a course, a book, or a tutorial titled "How to Find Zero-Days Like an APT." **That doesn't exist.** And here's the secret why:

**APT-level hacking is not about knowing a specific trick; it's a mastery of foundational knowledge, combined with a specific mindset and methodology.**

The "real resource" you're missing is not a single website, but a shift in your approach. You're trying to run before you can not only walk, but before you understand human anatomy, physics, and sports medicine.

### Why You Can't Do It Yet (And What's Missing)

You said you can "hack web apps with traditional known vulnerabilities." This is like being a mechanic who can only replace parts using a service manual. An APT is the engineer who *designs* the engine and knows how to create a new, undetectable flaw in it.

Here’s what's standing between you and that level:

1.  **Lack of Deep System Internals Knowledge:** You know how to exploit a SQLi in a web app. But do you know:
    *   How the Windows OS manages memory, processes, and access tokens?
    *   How the Linux kernel handles system calls and permissions?
    *   How CPU architectures (x86/x64/ARM) actually execute code at the register level?
    *   How network protocols are implemented at the packet level, beyond what Wireshark shows you?
    **Without this, you can't find bugs in the systems themselves.**

2.  **The "Unknown-Unknowns":** You don't know what you don't know. The world of advanced exploitation involves concepts you've likely not been exposed to:
    *   **Reverse Engineering:** Tearing apart compiled software (binaries) without its source code to understand how it works and where its weaknesses are.
    *   **Exploit Development:** The art of taking a discovered bug (like a buffer overflow) and crafting reliable code (the "exploit") to gain control. This involves knowledge of memory corruption, stack/heap overflows, ROP chains, etc.
    *   **Advanced Tradecraft:** How to evade EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response), AV, and network sensors. This isn't just using Metasploit's `shikata_ga_nai` encoder; it's about crafting custom malware, using living-off-the-land techniques (LOLBins), and understanding how security products work *from the inside*.

3.  **The Methodology Gap:** You're looking for known CVEs. APTs *create* new CVEs. Their process is:
    *   **Target Reconnaissance:** Choosing a specific target (e.g., a VPN appliance, a document parser, a network protocol).
    *   **Attack Surface Analysis:** Mapping all the parts of the target that accept input.
    *   **Fuzzing & Code Auditing:** Systematically throwing malformed data at the target (fuzzing) or manually reading code to find logical flaws.
    *   **Triaging:** Determining if a crash is exploitable.
    *   **Weaponization:** Developing the exploit into a reliable weapon.

### The Real Path Forward: Your Curriculum for Becoming "A Real Hacker"

Stop chasing "hacking" tutorials for a while. Start building the foundation. Here is your roadmap.

#### Phase 1: Build the Unshakable Foundation

*   **C Programming:** This is non-negotiable. It forces you to understand memory management, pointers, and data structures. It's the language of operating systems and the source of most memory corruption vulnerabilities.
*   **Assembly Language (x86/x64):** You must understand what the CPU is doing. You don't need to be a master programmer in it, but you must be able to read it. This is critical for reverse engineering and exploit development.
*   **Operating Systems Concepts:** Deeply understand processes, threads, virtual memory, the kernel, and system calls. Read books like *Windows Internals* or *Understanding the Linux Kernel*.

#### Phase 2: Learn the Core Advanced Skills

*   **Reverse Engineering:**
    *   **Tool:** Get comfortable with **Ghidra** (free, powerful), **IDA Pro** (industry standard, expensive), and **x64dbg**/WinDbg.
    *   **Practice:** Start with **CrackMes** (small challenges designed to be reverse engineered). Websites like [CrackMes.one](https://crackmes.one/) are perfect.
*   **Exploit Development:**
    *   **Start Here:** The legendary **"LiveOverflow"** YouTube channel is a gift from the gods for this topic. Watch his binary exploitation playlist.
    *   **Practice:** **pwn.college** is an incredible, free, and structured learning platform. **TryHackMe's** "Pwn" and "Binary Exploitation" paths are also good. Start with stack overflows on retired CTF machines.
*   **Web App Deep Dive:** Don't just test for OWASP Top 10. Learn to code complex web applications. You'll find vulnerabilities by understanding the developer's mindset and the framework's quirks. Look for logic flaws, race conditions, and insecure use of powerful backend functions.

#### Phase 3: Adopt the APT Mindset & Tradecraft

*   **Study the Masters:** Don't just read about APTs; read their **technical write-ups**.
    *   Follow **Google Project Zero**, **Mandiant**, **CrowdStrike**, and **Kaspersky** blogs.
    *   When they release a report on a new malware family, **try to understand the technical details**. How did the initial exploit work? How did the malware communicate? How did it evade detection?
*   **Practice in Realistic Environments:**
    *   **Pro Labs on TryHackMe/HackTheBox:** Labs like "RastaLabs" or "Offshore" on HTB simulate corporate networks.
    *   **Purple Team Labs:** These force you to think about evasion. How would you get a payload past the specific EDR on the box?
*   **Get Involved in the Community:**
    *   Follow security researchers on Twitter/X.
    *   Watch conference talks from **DEF CON, Black Hat, and Recon.**
    *   Listen to podcasts like **Darknet Diaries** for inspiration and **Security Now** for deep technical dives.

### A Concrete Example to Illustrate the Difference

*   **Your Current Level:** You find a WordPress site with an outdated plugin. You search for "WordPress Plugin X CVE-2023-12345 exploit," run a public script, and get a shell.
*   **The APT Level:** A state actor needs to breach a specific target using a Fortinet VPN. They:
    1.  Acquire the firmware for the target's Fortinet model.
    2.  Use Ghidra to reverse engineer the web server component that handles user login.
    3.  They fuzz the login request parser and discover a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability that no one has ever seen.
    4.  They write a custom exploit in C that uses a ROP chain to bypass ASLR and DEP, giving them remote code execution.
    5.  They craft the exploit to leave minimal traces and deploy a memory-resident backdoor.

### Summary: Why You Can't Find the "Real Resources"

You're looking for the **destination**, but you need a **map for the journey**. The "real resources" are the fundamental books, courses, and practice platforms for:

1.  **C & Assembly Programming**
2.  **Operating System Internals**
3.  **Reverse Engineering**
4.  **Exploit Development**

Stop focusing on "hacking" for now. Focus on **learning how computers truly work at a deep level.** The "hacking" will then emerge as a natural consequence of your understanding. This is a long and difficult path, but it is the only one that leads to the level of expertise you desire. You've taken the first, most important step by asking "why." Now, commit to the grind. Good luck.
